This does not apply to effects that cause a creature to count squares as difficult terrain (such as a solarian's graviton-attunement attacks). If you're attempting to suppress terrain created by a spell or other magical effect, you must successfully counteract the effect.</li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> You can choose to have the quantum field fill with fog, smoke, or another phenomenon that obscures vision. This functions as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.9XHmC2JgTUIQ1CCm]{Mist}. You can instead suppress one of these effects within your quantum field.</p><p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> You can choose to have the quantum field become greater difficult terrain, or suppress greater difficult terrain.</p>"
