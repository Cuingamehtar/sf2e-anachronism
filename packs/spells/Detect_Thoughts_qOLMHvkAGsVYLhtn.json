You can choose to ignore the thoughts of creatures you're familiar with so they don't interfere with your detection of other thoughts. The spell can penetrate some barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force barrier blocks it. Creatures who are immune to mental effects are immune to detection by this spell.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> You detect the number of thinking minds and whether or not the creatures are telepathic. Creatures with telepathy have louder thoughts than creatures who don't have telepathy and might be able to sense your intrusion, at the GM's discretion.</p>"
