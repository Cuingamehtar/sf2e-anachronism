Elemental barrier gains the trait you chose. The target gets a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. While the spell is in effect, the target can use the Shield Block reaction as if the elemental barrier was a raised shield.</p><p>The barrier has Hardness 6 and 40 HP. It has resistance 2 to one damage type based on the chosen trait: electricity or sonic for air, bludgeoning or piercing for earth, acid or slashing for metal, fire for fire, cold for water, or poison for wood. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use the spell's reaction against spells with the chosen elemental trait cast against the creature.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.spell-effects.Item.4BwlNXei3xMKygMv]{Spell Effect: Elemental Barrier}</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The barrier has 48 HP.</p><p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> The barrier has Hardness 8 and 52 HP.</p><p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The barrier has Hardness 8 and 60 HP.</p><p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> The barrier has Hardness 10 and 68 HP.</p><p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The barrier has Hardness 10 and 80 HP.</p>"
