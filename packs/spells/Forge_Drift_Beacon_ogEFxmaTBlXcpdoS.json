It becomes a Drift beacon that allows swifter travel to the surrounding region of space. The ritual requires at least 3 casters (to represent Triune's tripartite nature), but as many as 12 casters have been known to regularly perform this ritual. If the number of casters is not a multiple of 3, the ritual automatically fails.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The forging succeeds, and the entire space station becomes consecrated to Triune, gaining the effects of the consecrate ritual for a number of years equal to the number of casters who performed the ritual.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The forging succeeds.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The forging fails.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The forging fails spectacularly and causes a glitch in Triune's code, which might have tangible effects on the space station, like glitch gremlin infestations, a visit from a spectra repair squad, inexplicable technical difficulties becoming rampant, or even planar glitches. For at least 1 year, further attempts to forge a Drift beacon at the site fail.</p>"
