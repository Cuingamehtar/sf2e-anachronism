The target temporarily gains regeneration 7, which restores 7 Hit Points to it at the start of each of its turns. While it has regeneration, the target can't die from taking damage, and its dying condition can't increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures' dying condition at dying 3), though if its wounded value becomes 4 or higher, it stays @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} until its wounds are treated. If the target takes acid or fire damage, its regeneration deactivates until after the end of its next turn.</p><p>Once during the spell's duration, the creature can forgo healing Hit Points that round to regrow one damaged or ruined organ or reattach a severed body part by spending an Interact action to hold the body part to the area it was severed from.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.spell-effects.Item.4cFhz9knnHUHj3wi]{Spell Effect: Genetic Regeneration}</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> Increase the regeneration value by 2.</p>"
