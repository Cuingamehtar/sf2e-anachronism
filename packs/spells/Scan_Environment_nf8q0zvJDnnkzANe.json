You forecast the weather for the next hour, including the direction it will come from; learn which atmospheres, biomes, and gravity are in the area, as well as the direction and distance to those elements; and learn if anything in the area presents an environmental hazard, including cold or heat dangers (at what temperature range), radiation (at what severity), smoke effects, and underwater conditions. This is enough to detect large effects that span spaces over 30 feet in diameter only. You gain a general sense of where and how far away these dangers are.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The scanned area increases in radius by 1 mile.</p>"
