The genre of the game and effect of the spell depend on who you target when you cast it. Any creature targeted by this spell becomes immune to it for 24 hours, no matter what genre they experience.</p><ul><li>If you cast the spell targeting yourself and any number of willing allies, the targets enter a relaxing slice-of-life social simulation game where they can perform up to 1 hour of activities for the duration of the spell, including Refocusing, Repairing items, or simply evading an enemy by hiding in this virtual extradimensional space.</li><li>If you cast this spell targeting yourself or one willing ally, and one enemy, the targets enter a PvP game and are instructed to fight, using their current initiative. For the duration of the spell, either creature can manipulate fate once on each of its turns. This allows it to either roll twice and take the higher result on an attack roll or skill check it attempts against its opponent (a fortune effect) or force the opponent to roll twice on a saving throw against one of its abilities and take the lower result (a misfortune effect). The GM might decide that other genres of games exist that add additional rules or subsystems to resolving the spell. The spell ends if either target becomes unable to act or if they both agree to cease hostilities. Any results of the game, such as damage or conditions, persist after the game is over. If a player dies in this game, they die in real life.</li><li>If you cast this spell targeting one enemy, the target enters a PvE or puzzle game that traps them until they can complete the game. Once each turn, the target can spend 1 action to attempt a Computers or Perception check against your spell DC to escape the game. Teleportation magic doesn't help the creature escape unless the magic can transport someone into or out of a virtual space. When the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the target returns to the space it occupied when it was digitized, or to the nearest space if the original is now filled. The GM might decide that other genres of games allow for different skill checks but should only do so if the target has proficiency in the listed skill.</li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target completes the game and the spell ends.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The target makes progress toward completing the game. If the target already made progress, it completes the game and the spell ends.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The target makes no progress toward completing the game.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target loses the game and has to start over. It loses all progress it made.</p>"
