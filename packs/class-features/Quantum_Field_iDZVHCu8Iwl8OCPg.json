      "value": "<p>You can draw on paradoxical forces to create a reality-warping quantum field. It might manifest as a haze in the air that shows shimmers of alternate realities, appear as walls of glowing magical equations, or any other display you choose. The effects of your quantum field are determined by your paradox. You can further enhance and manipulate your quantum field through your witchwarper feat selections and by casting warp spells. You can activate or extend the duration of your quantum field by using reality-warping magic.</p><p>You have the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.actions.Item.ZoMpqQgDdlT13Jp0]{Warp Reality} action, which lets you activate your quantum field. This action gains the arcane or occult trait based on the tradition of your selected paradox. You also have @UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.actions.Item.30Nw5q4vWKCQIBIZ]{Quantum Pulse}, which lets you establish your quantum field quickly at the start of combat.</p>",
