Envoy directives include a way for the envoy to lead by example by spending more actions for increased effects. Directives have the auditory or visual trait depending on how you inspire your allies.</p><p>You begin with one envoy directive. You can learn more directives through the envoy class, envoy class feats, and your leadership style. You can issue one directive a round. Unless otherwise stated, an envoy's directive and the benefits it grants last until the beginning of your next turn.</p><p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.actions.Item.cmCtfURzpbzkxWsy]{Get 'Em!} envoy directive.</p>",
