      "value": "<p>There's nothing like a big gun (or maybe several) to get you through tough times. You've come to terms with the fact that a stray bullet from one of your barrages might sometimes hit an ally, but you try to minimize such instances of \"friendly fire.\" You've trained to avoid harming allies with your barrages and learned to expertly position your attacks around them.</p><p>When you attack with an area weapon, you can select a number of allies within the area equal to half your Constitution modifier. The selected allies are unaffected by the attack. In addition, enemies who succeed (but not critically succeed) on their save against an area attack you make are still @UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} until the start of your next turn.</p>",
