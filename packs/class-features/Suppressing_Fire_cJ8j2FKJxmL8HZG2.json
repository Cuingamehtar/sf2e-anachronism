      "value": "<p>You have a knack for using powerful weapons to harry your foes and hinder their movement, preventing them from operating at their peak. If you make an attack with a weapon that has the area trait (such as from the Area Fire or Auto-Fire actions), you use it in a manner that suppresses your targets. Enemies in the affected area who fail their save against your attack become @UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} until the start of your next turn. A suppressed target takes a –1 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. Some soldier abilities and class feats interact further with the suppressed condition.</p>",
