When you gain access to a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by your chosen connection, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your chosen connection and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on.
