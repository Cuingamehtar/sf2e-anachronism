Computers with improved systems might require multiple successes to access.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You access the system, or you achieve two successes toward accessing a system requiring more than one success.

Being locked out of a system prevents you from attempting another check to access it for the next hour.</p>"
