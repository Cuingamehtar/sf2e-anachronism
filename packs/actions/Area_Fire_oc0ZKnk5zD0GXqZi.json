For burst, you can position the center point anywhere within your first range increment. Any creatures in the area must succeed at a @Check[reflex|against:class|basic] save against your class DC plus the tracking value of the weapon (you don't roll an attack roll). This damage is area damage. Creatures who critically fail this save are subject to effects that occur on a critical hit with this weapon, including the weapon's critical specialization effect. Area Fire has an expend equal to the value listed on the weapon.</p>"
