      "value": "<p>You're an abundant source of electromagnetic radiation, which naturally amplifies the radiance of lights around you. Light sources in your possession (including those carried, cast on you, worn, or otherwise a part of you) are more luminousâ€”double the area illuminated by these light sources. If a light source you possess would deal damage or cause a harmful effect based on its area, the area of those additional effects are not increased by Amplify Radiance. Additionally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to counteract checks made to counteract darkness.</p>",
