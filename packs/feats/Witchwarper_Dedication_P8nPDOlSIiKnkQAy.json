You gain the Warp Reality action, but your quantum field is a @Template[type:burst|distance:10].</p><p>You cast spells like a witchwarper. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity. You gain a spell repertoire with two common cantrips from the spell list associated with your paradox, from the spells granted by your paradox, or any other cantrips of that tradition you learn or discover. You're trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting attribute for witchwarper archetype spells is Intelligence, and they are witchwarper spells of your paradox's tradition. You don't gain any other abilities from your choice of paradox.</p>",
