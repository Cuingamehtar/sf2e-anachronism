      "value": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have at least one hand free and are wielding a two-handed ranged weapon that doesn't have the area trait in your inactive hands.</p><hr /><p>Invented by a talented shobhad sniper over a thousand years ago, the so-called \"shobhad special\" is a devastating maneuver that is only possible by a creature with the shobhad-neh's unique combination of size, strength, extra limbs, and cultural sniping techniques. Much to your pride, you're one of the few who have mastered it. Attempt a fist Strike against a creature at least one size smaller than you. If the attack is successful, you deal no damage but the target is immediately thrown up to 30 feet in a direction of your choice. Then, Switch Hands and make a ranged Strike against the target with the required weapon; the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against this Strike. Regardless of whether this Strike is successful, the creature then falls @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} in whatever space is appropriate based on your throw.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.KxaYlC50zzHysJj8]{Titan Wrestler} skill feat, you can use Shobhad Special against creatures up to your size, or up to one size larger than you if you're legendary in Athletics.</p>",
