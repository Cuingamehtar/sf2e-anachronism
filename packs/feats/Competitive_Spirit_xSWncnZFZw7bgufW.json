Until the end of your next turn, you can attempt the same skill check to perform the same action or activity that the triggering ally performed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this skill check. If you achieve at least one degree of success higher than the triggering ally, this use of Competitive Spirit doesn't count toward its frequency. If you roll a critical failure on this skill check, you take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to all skill checks attempted with that skill for the next hour as you try new techniques to improve your future attempts.</p>",
