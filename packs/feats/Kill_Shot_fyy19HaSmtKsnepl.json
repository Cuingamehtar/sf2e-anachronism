You @UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.actions.Item.sLikawnrJJzHMYeC]{Aim} and then make a ranged Strike against your mark. If this attack is a success (but not a critical success), you deal maximum damage. Calculate this damage as if every die you would roll has a maximum result. On a critical success, roll the result normally, but if the double damage would be less than the result of a maximum damage on a normal success, use the maximum damage on the success instead.</p><p>If you spent 3 actions and your attack was a critical success, then you deal maximum damage and double the damage of that result as normal.</p>",
