You can make up to three ranged Strikes during this movement. Each ranged Strike you make must target a different creature within your first range increment (calculated from the point at which you took your attack at that target). Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty but doesn't increase your penalty until you've made all your attacks.</p>",
