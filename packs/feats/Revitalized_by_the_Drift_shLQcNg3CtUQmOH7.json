If you rest for 10 minutes while within the Drift, you gain Hit Points equal to your @Damage[(@actor.level *@actor.system.abilities.con.mod)[healing]]{Constitution modifier Ã— your level}. This is cumulative with any healing you receive from @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1kGNdIIhuglAjIp9]{Treat Wounds}.</p><p>Once per hour, you can focus or meditate on your inherent connection to the Drift. This is a 10-minute activity that has the concentrate and exploration traits. When you do, you're treated as if you'd rested for 10 minutes while in the Drift, save that the number of Hit Points you regain from this feat is halved.</p>",
