On a hit, you create an impressive display of solar energy between you and your foe. Increase the level of cover you receive from your enemy by one step. Lesser cover becomes standard cover, or standard cover becomes greater cover in the case of creatures at least one size category larger than you. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.</p><hr /><p><strong>Graviton-Attuned</strong> For the duration, if you don't have any cover against an attack targeting you, you gain lesser cover against that attack.</p><p><strong>Photon-Attuned</strong> For the duration, if the target you struck provides you cover against an enemy's attack, that enemy takes a â€“1 circumstance penalty to their attack roll.</p>",
