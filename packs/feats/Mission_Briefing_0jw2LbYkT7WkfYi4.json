You are trained in Mission Lore, a special Lore skill that can be used only to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge}, but on any topic related to an assignment, mission, or quest performed on behalf of another individual or organization. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Mission Lore, you get the effects of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.1Bt7uCW2WI4sM84P]{Dubious Knowledge} skill feat unless the question was already answered during a mission briefing. If you have legendary proficiency in Society, you gain expert proficiency in Mission Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Mission Lore by any other means.</p>",
