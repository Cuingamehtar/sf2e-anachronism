You can Interact with an item that weighs 1 Bulk or less to stow it into your Cloud Storage. A creature in your bond and on the same plane can remove an item from your Cloud Storage as an Interact action, but doing so takes 2 actions instead of 1 action. Your Cloud Storage has a capacity of 12 Bulk. This increases to 25 Bulk at 8th level, 50 Bulk at 12th level, and 75 Bulk at 16th level.</p>",
