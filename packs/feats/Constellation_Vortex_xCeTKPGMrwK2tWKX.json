A creature that starts its turn adjacent to you takes damage of an amount and type equal to the weapon damage of your solar weapon, with a @Check[reflex|against:solarian|basic] save against your class DC. If you already have an active vortex when you use Constellation Vortex, add another weapon to the vortex instead, up to a maximum of 3 weapons at any time. Each added weapon increases the damage of the vortex by 1. You can Sustain the vortex for up to 1 minute.</p><p>When the vortex ends, it shatters, dealing damage equal to your level, plus 1 for each weapon in the vortex, to all adjacent creatures. This damage is of the same type as your solar weapon.</p><p><strong>Graviton-Attuned</strong> Increase the damage of the vortex by 2 per weapon (including the first).</p><p><strong>Photon-Attuned</strong> Add @Damage[1[fire]] damage per weapon (including the first).</p><hr /><p><strong>Level (+3)</strong> The damage from each additional weapon increases by 2, and the extra damage from your attunement effect increases by 1.</p>",
