      "value": "<p>You implant one augmentation with an item level equal to your character level or lower. This augmentation doesn't count against your total implant limit. The first time you take this feat, the augmentation you receive is free as long as its item level is 1 or lower. You can upgrade this augmentation by swapping it out with another augmentation when you gain a level or by spending downtime replacing the augmentation as though changing out a feat. When you swap out the augmentation, you must pay the difference between the original and new augmentation each time you upgrade.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different augmentation each time. Retraining this feat requires paying the cost of the original augmentation.</p>",
