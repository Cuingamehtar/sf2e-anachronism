As a free action, that ally can immediately perform the lead by example actions of your last action, gaining any benefits and using any abilities that would normally be used as if you used two-actions to issue the direction. Use your Charisma modifier instead of your ally's when determining any relevant benefits, such as the status bonus to damage for Get 'Em!</p>",
