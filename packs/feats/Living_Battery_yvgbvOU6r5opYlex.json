      "value": "<p>Your body produces an overabundance of electrical energy, which you can emit as a blast of lightning or use to power technological devices. You can cast the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.kBhaPuzLUSwS6vVf]{Electric Arc} cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.</p><p>When you cast electric arc, you can also target batteries or tech items powered by batteries (in any combination). If you target a battery or tech item powered by a battery, that item isn't damaged. Instead, it regains 2 charges per spell rank. If the target is a tech item that needs a battery but doesn't currently have one, treat the item as if it had a battery with 2 charges per spell rank for 1 minute.</p>",
