You can tap into the latent magic in your scales to cast a cantrip as an innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. </p><p>If you are blessed by a god, choose one cantrip from the divine spell list. You can cast this cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. </p><p>If you are blessed by an aberrant force, choose one cantrip from the occult spell list. You can cast this cantrip as an occult innate spell at will. </p><p>Whenever you cast an innate spell granted by your Sigiled Scales or a feat that lists Sigiled Scales as a prerequisite, the sigils on your scales glow with magical energy, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius for a number of minutes equal to the spell's rank.</p>",
