This energy shield has the attuned and solarian traits and doesn't require a hand to use. You can Raise a Shield, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. You gain the Shield Block general feat.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.feat-effects.Item.q5W7fV1wXvqBFxt8]{Effect: Solar Shield}</p><p>While the shield is raised, you can use the Shield Block reaction with your shield. The shield has Hit Points equal to 5 plus twice your level and Hardness equal to half your level, rounded up. Your shield can't be broken, but if it's destroyed, you can't manifest a new shield for 10 minutes. If your shield vanishes due to you losing attunement, when you Attune to reform it, the shield returns with however many Hit Points it previously had. The shield regains all its lost Hit Points during your daily preparations and whenever you rest for at least 10 minutes, even if it's been destroyed.</p><p><strong>Graviton-Attuned</strong> If your shield is destroyed, it releases a shock wave. Adjacent enemies must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|against:solarian] save against your class DC or be @UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} for 1 round (2 rounds on a critical failure).</p><p><strong>Photon-Attuned</strong> If your shield is destroyed, it releases a flash of light. Adjacent enemies must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|against:solarian] save against your class DC or be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} for 1 round on a critical failure).</p>",
