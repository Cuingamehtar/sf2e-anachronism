      "value": "<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p>You force a rip in space that acts as a tunnel to a nearby location. Create two wormholes in unoccupied squares in line of effect that are within 100 feet, visible to you, and at least 15 feet apart. When a creature enters a wormhole's space, they emerge in an unoccupied space of their choice adjacent to the other wormhole. A creature that isn't flying treats all spaces lacking solid ground as occupied. If there's no valid space for the creature to enter, then both wormholes collapse and the creature remains in the space where it entered the first wormhole. The wormholes last for 1 round before collapsing, but you can Sustain the wormholes for up to 1 minute. Use your attunement when you take the Wormhole action to determine its attuned effects.</p><p><strong>Graviton-Attuned</strong> A creature beginning its turn adjacent to a wormhole must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|against:solarian|options:forced-movement] save against your class DC or be pulled into the wormhole.</p><p><strong>Photon-Attuned</strong> A creature entering the wormhole becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} until the start of its next turn.</p>",
