Until the beginning of your next turn, you and your allies can add the nonlethal trait to your attacks with weapons (without taking the normal penalty), and to your spells that deal damage and don't have the death or void trait.</p><p><strong>Lead by Example</strong> If you used two actions, Strike a target with a nonlethal attack. On a success, you gain a status bonus to damage equal to your Charisma modifier. On a critical success, an ally within 30 feet can Strike the target as a reaction using a nonlethal attack.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.feat-effects.Item.fa4T1oR8S0lF5888]{Effect: Take 'Em Alive}</p>",
