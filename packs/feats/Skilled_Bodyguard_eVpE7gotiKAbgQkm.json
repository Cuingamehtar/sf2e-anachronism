      "value": "<p>Your bulk and dexterous limbs are incredibly useful for ensuring that you keep your smaller allies out of harm's way. You move a number of willing, adjacent creatures that are smaller than you up to 5 feet each in a direction of your choice; the number of creatures you can move is equal to the number of unoccupied hands you currently have (including your inactive pair of hands). This counts as forced movement (meaning you cannot move a target into hazardous terrain or a space they cannot occupy).</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.KxaYlC50zzHysJj8]{Titan Wrestler} skill feat, you can use Skilled Bodyguard to move a creature of any size.</p>",
