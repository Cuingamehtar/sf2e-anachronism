      "value": "<p>Your varied life experiences let you adapt to nearly any situation. When you gain skill feats using adaptive talent, you gain two additional skill feats. In addition, you can adapt to the day's challenges by spending 10 minutes to plan. If you do, you can reselect the feats chosen with adaptive talent as if you'd made your daily preparations. You can't trade out feats with limited-use abilities that you've already used that day.</p>",
