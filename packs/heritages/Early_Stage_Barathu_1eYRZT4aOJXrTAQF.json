You have yet to see the full breadth of the cosmos and haven't adapted yourself to overcome its many threats or understand its various life-forms. Your form is highly mutable, as you haven't yet chosen to specialize or merge with other barathus. You're Small instead of Medium. You gain @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.3G8xUlgCjRmRJNfP]{Quick Squeeze} as a bonus feat. Additionally, you gain resistance to precision damage equal to half your level (minimum 1).</p>",
