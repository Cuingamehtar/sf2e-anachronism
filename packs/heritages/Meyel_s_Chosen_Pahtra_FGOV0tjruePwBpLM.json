      "value": "<p>You have an undeniable streak of luck that you believe is a blessing from your ancestral god Meyel. You might come from a long line of mystics. Perhaps you were born at a holy site on Pulonis, or you reached out in fervent prayer at a time of crisis. Most of Meyel's chosen can point to at least one past event when their goddess might have intervened to save them from death or some other awful fate. Whether metaphorically or literally, you always seem to land on your feet. The first time each day that you critically fail a saving throw, you immediately reroll the saving throw as a free action; this is a fortune effect.</p>",
