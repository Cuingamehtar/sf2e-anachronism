      "value": "<p>Your ancestors lived on Golarion, and though the precise circumstances of their survival are lost to the Gap, you strongly identify with the lost planet's cultures. You become trained in Golarion Lore, and you learn a bonus language that was spoken in your lineage's region of origin. You have familiarity with archaic weapons and, for purposes of proficiency, treat one archaic weapon of your choice that's a martial weapon as a simple weapon, or that's an advanced weapon as a martial weapon.</p>",
