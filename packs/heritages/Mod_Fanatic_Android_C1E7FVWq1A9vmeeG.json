Your body has one armor upgrade slot that you can use to install armor upgrades and that doesn't count toward your armor's total number of upgrades. You can install and uninstall armor upgrades into your personal upgrade slot using the Install Upgrade activity. Choose one common armor upgrade with an item level of 1 or less. You begin with this armor upgrade already installed in your upgrade slot (you don't need to pay the credits to purchase this starting upgrade).</p>",
