As an inheritor of these skills, you are exceptionally talented at seeing to your own subsistence and even that of others while still performing other critical tasks. You can perform the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.kV3XM0YJeS2KCSOb]{Scout} exploration activity at the same time as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.EA5vuSgJfiHH7plD]{Track} exploration activity. During downtime, you can perform the Subsist downtime activity alongside any one other downtime activity you are capable of performing.</p>",
