If you roll a success on a Will saving throw against an effect that was created by a creature with the kucharn trait or a creature that you know is allied with the Swarm, you get a critical success instead. You gain these benefits against any creature affected by a spell or effect that controls it. Additionally, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.actions.Item.nAJeT29ZJvqeg98h]{Rebellious Defiance} action.</p>",
