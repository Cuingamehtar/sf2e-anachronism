Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to build the Universe in ancient times.</p><p>When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head (or another visible part of your anatomy if you don't have a head) instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an <em>aeon stone</em> with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Dt6B1slsBy8ipJu9]{Disarm} action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are @UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} until you return it to orbit your head again.</p><p>There are various types of <em>aeon stones</em>, each with a different appearance and magical effect. Each <em>aeon stone</em> also gains a resonant power when slotted into specific items, such as weapons with the aeon trait or antique magical devices called <em>wayfinders</em>.</p><hr /><p>This deep-blue prism with cloudy inclusions is light as a feather. Its resonant power gives you a +1 item bonus to Acrobatics checks.</p><p><strong>Activateâ€”Fly Free</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> (concentrate)</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain a fly Speed for 1 minute equal to your Speed or 20 feet, whichever is greater.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e-anachronism.equipment-effects.Item.xZ5XMY55S42aGyjg]{Effect: Aeon Stone (Uplifting)}</p>"
